# Diary Entries FYP:

## 16 October 2025:
Other coursework has taken much more time than expected. I have created a Godot emviornment and I will begin the programming on that, with a movable player by Monday. Research has been going much slower than expected. Will resume over the weekend and into the next week. I will have a small paragraph outlining what a game programming pattern is and an example from a real game in which one was likely used by Monday afternoon. Laptop is currently broken, inhibiting progress slightly, however, a new charger has been ordered and will hopefully fix the issue within the next few days. If the issue is not resolved tomorrow, I will reference my risks and mitigations and work through my technological failure mitigation.

## 9 October 2025:
Abstract, risks and mitigations, timeline, and bibliography complete and will be turned in tonight. This weekend I plan on working on some basic game feature lists, finding my reference games, and beginning to look into video game design patterns. 

## 7 October 2025:
I have continued to write my assertation. I am slightly behind schedule with my abstract as the research needed has been more than expected, however I am ahead of schedule with my resources list for my bibliography. My research has centered around game engines and the pros and cons of the different ones. I still need some research on game programming design. I will be completing my abstract tonight, if not tomorrow morning and beginning my risk assesment tomorrow.

## 4 October 2025:

On Thursday, I had my meeting with my advisor. The meeting went to plan, confirmed I was on the right track with my ideas. I have began my week by week plan and will complete that this weekend, as well as beginning my abstract. This upcoming week, I have to complete my risk assessment and project abstract. I plan on completing my abstract by Wednesday and the risk assesment by Thursday. It is important to keep on top of the project at this point as to not fall behind as I plan. The project plan is due on the 10th.

## 29 September 2025:

I have began the planning of my project. I have a meeting scheduled with my advisor for Thursday and hope to have a large chunk of my plan complete before then. I also plan on writing a list of questions and advice I would like for this meeting so it can go as seamless as possible. I am currently working towards deciding the basics of my project such as the program I will use for development, focuses of my report and research, my timeline, and books and resources I will use. I am also looking into what existing games I will analyse technically and break down to use as inspiration.
