# Diary Entries FYP:

## 29 September 2025:

I have began the planning of my project. I have a meeting scheduled with my advisor for Thursday and hope to have a large chunk of my plan complete before then. I also plan on writing a list of questions and advice I would like for this meeting so it can go as seamless as possible. I am currently working towards deciding the basics of my project such as the program I will use for development, focuses of my report and research, my timeline, and books and resources I will use. I am also looking into what existing games I will analyse technically and break down to use as inspiration.
