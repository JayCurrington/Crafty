# Diary Entries FYP:
## 12 December 2025
Report and retrospective took longer than expected. Video has been listed to youtube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFEr_yzgYOc. The report and retrospective are ready to be submitted. I finished up the last few bits of code cleanup and interaction today. I am aware these changes are very very late and I will strive to complete code on a more timely basis going foreward. I will do one go-over of the diary with a spell check, and then create the zip file for submission.

## 10 December 2025
I aim to finish the first draft of my retrospective, report, and a script for my video today. I am mostly complete with my report and retrospective. I completed the last of my coding, the player now has an inventory system that will be altered early next term to use a type object programming pattern, the way objects are stored in the inventory is by storing the data as an array of two element arrays which are formatted \[type, quantity\]. Tomorrow I will film the video and complete my editing so that they can be submitted late tomorrow or at latest, friday morning.

## 8 December 2025
I have been primarily working on my report and retrospective. I have completed the last small chunk of reading into game programming patterns, and I am now focusing on the writing itself and preparing for my presentation.

## 4 December 2025
When the player presses the 'E' button, the object currently being detected dissapears. The player does not keep track of the objects it has picked up and the object does not get removed, just dissapears. My presentation for the Viva is mostly complete. Ha da meeting with David today, I was concerned with the possibility of the code I have written being under the expected amount due to how streamlined GDScript is, however he assured that due to the game engine having other elements and that I have completed all my goals, I will be okay. I will be sure to make sure I finish up the inventory.

## 26 November 2025
While I still feel behind, I am happy with the progress I have made today to catch up. I have been struggling a lot to find proper Godot tutorial and documentation for their 3D objects. Due to it primarily being a 2D platform until recently, a majority of the developers, and in turn, forum questions, dcoumentation, and useful tutorials are for 2D games, which this is not. While I am able to adapt some of these resources into my 3D game, it is far from easy and takes quite abit of troubleshooting and trying to find the correct wording to find what I need. Today I got my player to interact with an object. The pickup is not quite working, but when a player walks in the vicinity of an object, the object will tell the player and in turn a menu will show up saying press E to pick up. This is great progress and I am approcahing the end of what I intended to implement for first term.

## 25 November 2025
Report has about 1000 words, being written on google drive, so not being uploaded to github yet. I will add a version when it is completed. I have been finding research to be going much better since swapping my focus. Tomorrow I will work more on the programming side rather than the research as I need more code for my interim report. The researching aspects is much more time consuming than expeacted and I am having the opposite issue than expected where my programming is coming second to my research.

## 23 November 2025
Swamped currently with other uni work. I am feeling behind on my research for this. While this is stressful, Iplan on getting parts of my report together, and seeing what major gaps I can fill rather than focusing on small techincal bits. The technicalities can come later.

## 20 November 2025
Issues with graphics driver. Godot having issues with Vulkan. I have swapped the default driver and will need to look into what exactly the issue is. Only collision meshes and no rendered files showing for a while.

## 14 November 2025
Decided that the indie game research wasn't going in the direction I intended. I wanted to look at indie game development and trends of games released and team sizes, however I was struggling to find resources so I have changed my research to in game crafting systems. This will be relevant to my project as I am using crafting as a main feature. I have lost time to this difficulty with researching and not finding resources that feel relevant enough to the programming of this project. I will be working on code this weekend and catching up on research.

## 10 November 2025
Read up on the relevance of Godot in the game programming sphere. I am feeling slightly stressed about my progress as the last week has been full of coursework from other classes. I am hoping to catch up on my research, however I also need to begin to focus on specific elements that are needed in the report for the end of term. I am also catching up on programming, however there are more available resources for programming than research. I am a tad concerned that my reserch should be more focused on programming and development, so I will steer in that direction.

## 3 November 2025
Began reading up on indie games and what classifies an indie game. I am struggling to find research that is relevant to both programming and indie game development. I would like to read more on specifically Godot's impact on indie games and game development, however am struggling to find relevant articles. I am also struggling to find relevant articles that are not web blogs or videos. I also wrote a section about Potion Permit. I am behind on my game references but on track with the rest of my research.

## 30 October 2025
Before my meeting with my advisor, I was sure to have a section about game programming patterns complete. While unedited, it covers 5/6 main design patterns. I will need more about this in the future. Had a meeting with advisor which went very well. Talked about timing and yet again moved the timeline around. Spoke about project progress and I was glad to hear I am on track.

## 28 October 2025:
Writing paragraph today. Will be done by tomorrow. Laptop charger finally working, allows me to work while not on my desktop PC which means more productivity. I have re-worked my plan with my advisor and am looking for a meeting this thursday with him to talk in person. 

## 24 October 2025:
Forgot to log in the digital diary so I am preemptively adding my written journal entry. I am behind on my research, will be reading through library books and writing paragraph on the game programming patterns this week/weekend. Will also add player interaction with objects if time allows this week.

## 20 October 2025:
Added in the player movement, the player now can walk, jump, and looks in the direction of movement. The camera follows the player, however player jump creates weird movement with the camera. The Player model has been made and may be tweaked later. Godot proof of concept is on track. Next implementation will be the ability to iunteract with objects and fixing the camera.

## 16 October 2025:
Other coursework has taken much more time than expected. I have created a Godot emviornment and I will begin the programming on that, with a movable player by Monday. Research has been going much slower than expected. Will resume over the weekend and into the next week. I will have a small paragraph outlining what a game programming pattern is and an example from a real game in which one was likely used by Monday afternoon. Laptop is currently broken, inhibiting progress slightly, however, a new charger has been ordered and will hopefully fix the issue within the next few days. If the issue is not resolved tomorrow, I will reference my risks and mitigations and work through my technological failure mitigation.

## 9 October 2025:
Abstract, risks and mitigations, timeline, and bibliography complete and will be turned in tonight. This weekend I plan on working on some basic game feature lists, finding my reference games, and beginning to look into video game design patterns. 

## 7 October 2025:
I have continued to write my assertation. I am slightly behind schedule with my abstract as the research needed has been more than expected, however I am ahead of schedule with my resources list for my bibliography. My research has centered around game engines and the pros and cons of the different ones. I still need some research on game programming design. I will be completing my abstract tonight, if not tomorrow morning and beginning my risk assesment tomorrow.

## 4 October 2025:
On Thursday, I had my meeting with my advisor. The meeting went to plan, confirmed I was on the right track with my ideas. I have began my week by week plan and will complete that this weekend, as well as beginning my abstract. This upcoming week, I have to complete my risk assessment and project abstract. I plan on completing my abstract by Wednesday and the risk assesment by Thursday. It is important to keep on top of the project at this point as to not fall behind as I plan. The project plan is due on the 10th.

## 29 September 2025:
I have began the planning of my project. I have a meeting scheduled with my advisor for Thursday and hope to have a large chunk of my plan complete before then. I also plan on writing a list of questions and advice I would like for this meeting so it can go as seamless as possible. I am currently working towards deciding the basics of my project such as the program I will use for development, focuses of my report and research, my timeline, and books and resources I will use. I am also looking into what existing games I will analyse technically and break down to use as inspiration.
