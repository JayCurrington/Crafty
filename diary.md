# Diary Entries FYP:

## 4 October 2025:

On Thursday, I had my meeting with my advisor. The meeting went to plan, confirmed I was on the right track with my ideas. I have began my week by week plan and will complete that this weekend, as well as beginning my abstract. This upcoming week, I have to complete my risk assessment and project abstract. I plan on completing my abstract by Wednesday and the risk assesment by Thursday. It is important to keep on top of the project at this point as to not fall behind as I plan. The project plan is due on the 10th.

## 29 September 2025:

I have began the planning of my project. I have a meeting scheduled with my advisor for Thursday and hope to have a large chunk of my plan complete before then. I also plan on writing a list of questions and advice I would like for this meeting so it can go as seamless as possible. I am currently working towards deciding the basics of my project such as the program I will use for development, focuses of my report and research, my timeline, and books and resources I will use. I am also looking into what existing games I will analyse technically and break down to use as inspiration.
